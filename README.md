- 👋 Hi, I’m @Aspergerman7082
- 👀 I’m interested in gaming, coding, and learning everything about what makes a computer tick...inside and out!
- 🌱 I’m currently self-learning the basics of coding, and I am by no means a Pro yet...and I'm open to any tips or
     advice any of you Pro's out there are willing to share!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects involving video games, such as Minecraft, Star Wars: Empire at War, as
     well as simply learning the tools of the trade.
- 📫 If anyone is interested in contacting me, my email is whaleofaspergia@gmail.com.
